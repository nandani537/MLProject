## End to End Machine Learning Project
# Nandani's Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my machine learning portfolio! This repository showcases my end-to-end machine learning project using CatBoost, Python, and Flask, with a focus on data preprocessing, model training, and deployment.

# ML Project Portfolio

Welcome to my machine learning project portfolio! This repository contains a machine learning pipeline using CatBoost for model training, Flask for deployment, and a variety of utility modules for error handling and logging.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Sections

1. **Home**: An introduction page with a brief overview of the project and any relevant links.
2. **About**: Detailed information about the project background, purpose, and objectives.
3. **Model Training**: Includes training scripts, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.
4. **Deployment**: A Flask web application that hosts the trained model.
5. **Utilities**: Custom Python modules for error handling, logging, and other reusable code.
6. **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and analysis.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, youâ€™ll need the following:

- **Python 3.6+**
- **CatBoost** (for model training)
- **Flask** (for web deployment)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for data analysis)
- **Virtual environment** (optional but recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nandani537/Nandani-Portfolio.git

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:

   ```bash
   cd MLProject

3. **Create a virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate

4. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

5. **Run the Flask application**:

  python app.py

  ### Open `index.html` in Your Preferred Web Browser

- **In Visual Studio Code**: 
  - Right-click on `index.html` in the Explorer panel.
  - Select **"Open with Live Server"** (requires the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) installed in Visual Studio Code).
  
- **Alternatively**: 
  - Open the file directly in your browser by navigating to the project directory in your file explorer.
  - Double-click on `index.html` to open it.
