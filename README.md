## End to End Machine Learning Project
# Nandani's Machine Learning 

Welcome to my machine learning project! This repository showcases my end-to-end machine learning project using CatBoost, Python, and Flask, with a focus on data preprocessing, model training, and deployment.

# ML Project 

Welcome to my machine learning project ! This repository contains a machine learning pipeline using CatBoost for model training, Flask for deployment, and a variety of utility modules for error handling and logging.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Sections

1. **Home**: An introduction page with a brief overview of the project and any relevant links.
2. **About**: Detailed information about the project background, purpose, and objectives.
3. **Model Training**: Includes training scripts, data preprocessing, and model evaluation.
4. **Deployment**: A Flask web application that hosts the trained model.
5. **Utilities**: Custom Python modules for error handling, logging, and other reusable code.
6. **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and analysis.
