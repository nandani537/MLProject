## üìù Project Details

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- **Location**: `src/components/`
- **Description**: Includes scripts for data cleaning and preparation. Handles tasks such as:
  - Missing value handling
  - Feature engineering
  - Data transformations for model compatibility

### 2. Model Training

- **Location**: `src/pipeline/`
- **Description**: Contains scripts for training the CatBoost model on preprocessed data.
  - Logs training metrics for analysis
  - Saves model artifacts in the `artifacts/` directory for future use or deployment

### 3. Flask Deployment

- **Location**: `app.py`
- **Description**: Main application script that serves the model through a simple UI.
  - HTML templates (`home.html` and `index.html`) are located in the `templates/` directory.
  - Uses Flask to deploy the model as a web service with a user-friendly interface.

### 4. Logging and Error Handling

- **Location**: `src/`
  - **Logging Module**: `logger.py`
  - **Exception Handling Module**: `exception.py`
- **Description**: Provides structured logging and error management throughout the application. Ensures efficient debugging and tracking of events and errors.
